# LAN-Sync-VM

The Sync VM is specifically designed to further accelerate the distribution of LAN Launcher content. In addition, it is designed to provide all available games, regardless of whether they are installed in the LAN Launcher or not. This ensures that players can install any content when no internet is available, or if no existing LAN Launcher installations are active on the network.

We have optimized the virtual machine so that it can be set up in the kind of "Fire and forget" - a further configuration is not necessary. After the start, the Sync VM starts working independently. The only prerequisites are an existing Internet connection and sufficient free space.


## System requirements
* 1 TB+ free space
* 4 GB+ RAM
* 64 bit Debian or Ubuntu system
